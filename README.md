# Bootstrap Cascade Layers (will change the name)

## What's This?

Bootstrap, but dragged kicking and screaming into 2025. We're talking:

- **`@use`** - Because `@import` is literally being deleted from Sass
- **`@layer`** - Cascade layers so you can actually override Bootstrap without `!important` spam
- **Modern CSS** - Custom properties, modern color functions, you know, the good stuff
- **Powered by ⚡️LightningCSS**

## Under Active Development
