# Bootstrap Cascade Layers (will change the name)

> Because `@import` is so 2015 💀

## What's This?

Bootstrap, but dragged kicking and screaming into 2025. We're talking:

- **`@use`** - Because `@import` is literally being deleted from Sass
- **`@layer`** - Cascade layers so you can actually override Bootstrap without `!important` spam
- **Modern CSS** - Custom properties, modern color functions, you know, the good stuff
- **Powered by ⚡️LightningCSS**

## Why Though?
Because i was bored (jk lols)

Plus, trying to override Bootstrap styles in 2025 shouldn't require a degree in CSS specificity warfare. 😉
